My Name is Tina Yazdizadeh. I am now pursuing my education toward a Master of Information Technology program with specialization is Data Science at Carleton University, Ottawa, ON. My current research is focused on intersection of the very demanding fields, namely, "Text Mining" and "Cybersecurity". Before joining  department of Information Technology at Carleton University, I had received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering(Software) from University of Tehran. As my B.Sc. thesis, I worked on Map Matching Using GPS Data, a reserach work which was supported by [TAPSI Co](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAPSI). as a growing E-Taxi company very similar to Uber.  
My objective is to be among the first ranking students in my graduate program and doing a thesis which is highly related to data science with daily real life applications especially those related to the security, economy, stock market and housing market and so on. Toward this goal, I have passed several courses and performed projects in the field of data analytics and still trying my best to select my graduate study thesis in the field of big data, machine learning in the context of artificial intelligence with security specialization.
