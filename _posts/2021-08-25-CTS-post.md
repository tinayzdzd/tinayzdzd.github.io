It is now almost a year since I joined <a href="https://www.csit.carleton.ca/wshi/">Prof. Wei Shiâ€™s</a> research team at  <a href="https://carleton.ca/">Carleton University</a>. I started my work by participating in Contact Tracing System (CTS) project as a developer. It was really my honor to be a member of a pioneer team in solving COVID-19 related issues.
Hope the pandemic is over soon and people all around the world live in peace and healthy, although the demand for research in the field of AI and Data Analytics for assessing similar problems in the world remains to be answered by researchers.
